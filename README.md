# Markdown table of contents generator

I create this little script for helping me documenting my courses and practicing javascript/nodejs enviroment.

Generates a `TABLE_OF_CONTENTS.md` file.

# Requirements
1. Node Js
2. Shell (Such as powershell, bash or CMD, etc).

# Course Lessons folder structure

The script only works if you have the next structure.

```bash
1_hello_world
2_alert_and_console_log
3_data_types
```

# TO-DOs
1. Make an argv implementation for set the repo input-output or easily using a dotenv variables.
2. Ignore custom files from the table cycle recognicion.

# Instructions
1. Clone the repo
2. Paste the file inside a repo and run the script using `node markdownlist.js`
